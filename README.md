# Tu Much Exploration @TUM
---
New repository for research @TUM looking into Multi-Robot Exploration by using various enhancements to existing Exploration techniques.

## Some known bugs for basic bug tracking

needed:  
    - \fix decentralized version  
    - check all compared approaches to increase validity  
    - \basic travel_distance logging  
    - one big map for testing  
    - \slam proofing all maps again
    - \rerunning mapping of all maps
    - rerunning simulation

possible:  
    - get more information about chosen frontiers (distance, visibility etc.)  
    - \new spreading method for better overall spreading of robots  
      - try max spreading  
      - and mean method  
    - big refactor with liniting and removing all unneeded files
