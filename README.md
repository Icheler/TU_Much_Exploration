# Tu Much Exploration @TUM
---
New repository for research @TUM looking into Multi-Robot Exploration by using various enhancements to existing Exploration techniques.

## Some known bugs for basic bug tracking

overall:  

- completely working version with slam_toolbox
- working version with wavepropagation for correct distances
- decentralized
  
problems:

- world to map transform is wrong
- some values are shallow copies which leads to issues
- save all relevant values for start
- change methods to work with input values and not class values
